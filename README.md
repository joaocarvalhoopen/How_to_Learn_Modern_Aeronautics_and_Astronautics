# How to Learn Modern Aeronautics and Astronautics

A path of self study using books, online resources (sites and courses). 
The idea is to use the resources of 5 fronts to learn this subject.
* Engineering Aeronautics and Astronautics
* PPL General Aviation
* Sailplanes/Gliders
* Aeromodelism
* Simulation

## Disclaimer
I'm an engineer but I'm not a Aeronautics and Astronautics engineer! I'm only doing this learning path on my own and have I a real drive and passion to learn it. I share with others the previous information because it is the information that I have found more useful and in same places that I haven't already reed it, I used the best reviews after reading several comments and what look to me to be the best sources. Has I go on this path of reading all those books I will update this repository with my findings. I'm doing it for the pleasure of knowing more about this subject (it can take 4 to 5 years :-D ). 

## Have fun!
Best regards, <br>
